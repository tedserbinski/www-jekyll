Hello üëã and thanks for stopping by. This is where I hang out online and share insights and lessons I've learned *(and some pictures* üñºÔ∏è  *too, scroll down)*.

Why?

Because of *you*  ü§ü.

I enjoy helping people be great. And I enjoy helping people build great things‚Äîwhether a startup business, a technical product, themselves as leaders, or even building a family! And double bonus if you're in the mobility industry or passionate about Detroit.
