Yes, that's correct--my new <a href="http://drupal.org/project/olf">OLF module</a> is ready for consumption. What's OLF? Well it stands for "outgoing links filter" and this module is a simple filter that finds all outgoing links (e.g., links that point to external websites relative to your website) and allows you to add a customizable class to these links. From there, you can easily add some CSS magic to add in icons or attach some unobtrusive JavaScript.

So why do that? Well it's a <a href="http://www.maxdesign.com.au/presentation/external/">method for making more accessible links</a>. And plus,  opening a new window to show that you are leaving the site is just super annoying--an icon is far more unobtrusive.

This module also currently follows my trend of releasing modules from random cafes around the globe. Just a few weeks ago, <a href="http://tedserbinski.com/2006/09/20/menu_bar_2_0_released_from_belgium">I released my menu bar from Belgium</a>. Today, I release my OLF module from a cafe in San Francisco. What's next? Well, we'll just have to wait and see :-p
