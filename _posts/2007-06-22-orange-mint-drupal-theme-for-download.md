As noted in <a href="http://tedserbinski.com/2007/05/20/ted-2-0-site-redesign">my previous post</a>, the previous <strong>ts</strong> theme, called "Orange Mint" is now available for download :-)

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tedserbinski/590097653/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1163/590097653_083c9e387f_m.jpg" width="240" height="197" align="left" hspace="6" vspace="6" alt="&quot;Orange Mint&quot; Drupal theme screenshot" /></a>

Note, this theme works with Drupal 4.7, but will require a tiny bit of work to work with Drupal 5, I leave this as an exercise for the reader :-)

Because this theme is highly limited--it's a simple blog theme--and because it needs to be updated to Drupal 5 and a few bugs probably need to be squashed, I'm not putting this in the Drupal theme repository, as it's not 100% ready for there. But if anyone wants to take the theme, adjust it, make it more usable and upload it, by all means, please do so! I just ask that a credit link back here as the original source, that's all!

So have a play around, there are a couple theming tricks in there. Leave your feedback and any questions, cheerios!
