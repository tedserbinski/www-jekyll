At the beginning of 2019, [Techstars Mobility transformed to Techstars Detroit](https://tedserbinski.com/mobility/transforming-techstars-mobility-to-techstars-detroit/).

The word "mobility" was becoming too limiting to attract world-class founders.
I wanted to reach a broader audience of entrepreneurs who may not label themselves as mobility but still fit my thesis for the future.

My thesis expanded from the movement of people and goods to:

> Investing in technologies bridging the gap between the physical and digital worlds.

This thesis is a superset of the technologies transforming all sorts of industries like transportation, automotive, manufacturing, agriculture, and healthcare.

As Matt Burns from TechCrunch put it succinctly, ["Mobility is baked into Detroit, but Detroit is more than mobility."](https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/10/techstars-detroit-announce-first-class-after-major-refocus/)

> No longer is Detroit telling the world how to move.<br>
> The world is telling Detroit how to move. &mdash; *Ted Serbinski*

And that's what Techstars Detroit is all about.
