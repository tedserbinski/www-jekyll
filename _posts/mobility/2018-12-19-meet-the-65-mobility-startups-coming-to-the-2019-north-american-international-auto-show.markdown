Today I’m excited to introduce the 65 mobility startups coming from around the world to the 2019 the North American International Auto Show (aka the Detroit Auto Show). These startups will be exhibiting at [AutoMobili-D](https://naias.com/automobili-d/), the technology-focused expo of the Detroit Auto Show that is running in its 3rd year from Monday, Jan. 14 through Thursday, Jan. 17. No other event in North America provides an international platform for this vast array of companies, organizations and mobility thought leaders under one roof.

I continue to be blown away by the growth of the mobility startup area at AutoMobili-D. Since its inception 3 years ago, the startup area has grown by 59%. The founders of these startups understand that any key decisions in automotive and supplier strategy eventually go through Detroit. With startups coming from all around the world to Detroit, it’s clear that Detroit’s role in the future of mobility is as strong as ever.

For 2019, a few stats on the startup area at AutoMobili-D:
- **65 mobility startups, a 14% increase over 2018, hailing from 10 countries** around the world
- The mobility startups’ exhibits take up **27% of the floor space at AutoMobili-D** and represent **45% of all exhibitors at AutoMobili-D**
- **86% of the startups have existing relationships** with automotive OEMs and suppliers
- **77% of the startups are first-time exhibitors**
- Collectively they **employ over 872 individuals** worldwide


These mobility startups are building a wide range of technologies and businesses that span:
- Autonomous
- Connected Car
- Electrification
- Fleet Management
- Hardware / Sensors
- Logistics
- Manufacturing
- Mapping / Journey Planning / Multi-Modal
- Personal Mobility / Last Mile Vehicles
