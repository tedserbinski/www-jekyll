If you're an automotive mobility startup, secure your spot to exhibit June 9-11th at the 2020 Detroit Auto Show (aka the North American International Auto Show).

Yes, this is June, NOT January. The show has moved to the warmer months. Even hotter is the increased exposure for startups that will have booths on the main floor, alongside automotive OEMs and suppliers.

<mark>→<a href="https://planetm.connect.space/automobili-d-2020/forms">If you'd like to attend, APPLY NOW <em>(select startup form)</em> to secure your spot for $499. First come, first served — don't delay.</a></mark>

#### What you need to know
- Attend the 2020 Detroit Auto Show from June 9 (setup) through June 11 (teardown).
- The cost is $499 and there are only 50 startup spots available. Space is open on a first-come, first-served basis. The deadline for applications is April 30, 2020, or until all startup spots are confirmed and paid.
- All startup applications will be reviewed on a first-come, first-served basis. Once an application is approved, payment will need to be completed to secure the spot.
- Startup applications will be reviewed on a rolling basis starting March 2. Notifications will begin going out mid-March with payment due on receipt. Startups that fail to pay will vacate their spot to the next qualified startup.


## Why I'm #LongDetroit and the Detroit Auto Show

As I wrote in a previous blog post, [I'm #LongDetroit as the startup ecosystem continues to grow](https://tedserbinski.com/mobility/detroit/im-longdetroit-even-as-techstars-detroit-winds-down/). I'm working closely with my friends (and Techstars mentors) [Jake Sigal](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jakesigal/) and [Massimo Baldini](https://www.linkedin.com/in/massimobaldini/). Together, we're supporting PlanetM's efforts to shape the future of mobility at the North American International Auto Show.

The move of the auto show to June is symbolic.

It's a sign of the changing automotive industry and a sign of a changing Detroit.

Detroit is a magical place with tons of amazing things going on. Having the show in the summer will highlight all of the significant changes going on in Detroit. While you can certainly see them in the winter, it is much easier to experience them in the warm outdoors.

The last five years have shown the importance of Detroit in the future of mobility.

Silicon Valley did NOT beat Detroit. Detroit did NOT beat Silicon Valley.

> **Future Mobility =** _(manufactured steel)_ **Detroit** **+** **Silicon Valley** _(serviced software)_

That's always been my perspective. We go further when we're together.
