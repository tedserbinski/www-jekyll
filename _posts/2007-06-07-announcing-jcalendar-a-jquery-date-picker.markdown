title: Announcing jCalendar - a jQuery date picker

<p><strong>NOTE: This project has been superceded by the most excellent <a href="http://jquery.com/plugins/project/jquery-calendar">jQuery Calendar</a>. All development on this plugin will now be merged with that project.</strong></p>

I am pleased to announce that my jQuery date picker is now ready for consumption, check it out here:

[jCalendar](http://tedserbinski.com/jcalendar/index.html)

This plugin was originally written to improve the interface for adding activities on <a href="http://www.mothersclick.com/">MothersClick.com</a> and will be working as the new input widget for date module. Initial mom reactions have been extremely positive (from a couple beta testers) and we hope to roll this into production after we iron out the kinks with Karen to get this into <a href="http://drupal.org/project/date">date module</a> as the new default widget.

This interface was largely inspired by <a href="http://www.basecamphq.com/">BaseCamp</a> and is quite accessible and works when JavaScript is disabled.

Right now it is a stand alone jQuery plugin, but soon it should be the new default widget for date module. Gerhard has expressed interest to add this to <a href="http://drupal.org/project/event">event module</a> and Boris and Steven from <a href="http://www.bryght.com/">Bryght</a> have also expressed interest in contributing to this plugin and extending it, fitting my long term vision of working similar to Google Calendar, and perhaps even inclusion for Drupal 7---a lot easier to choose a submitted date, huh?

So please give it a whirl, post bug reports, and let me know what you think!
