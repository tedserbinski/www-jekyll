Every week, in a bewildered state, someone asks me &ldquo;Hey Ted, why did you move from *San Francisco* to, uh, *Detroit*? Are you crazy?&rdquo;

I pause, let out a sigh, and respond with:

> Ten years from now, San Francisco will be just as good as it is today. But in ten years, Detroit will be a roaring city once again, defining a new technology hub at the intersection of muscle and brains. Where do you want to be in ten years? Status quo? Or one of the **heroes that rebuilt a city**?
> <small>Ted Serbinski</small>

Almost before I can finish, I can see in that person&rsquo;s face the transition from bewilderment to excitement, as they realize, I didn&rsquo;t just relocate to Detroit for a job; [I relocated to create a legacy][1].

Downtown Detroiters, helping to rebuild the city, **choose to be here**. They are not taking the easy route to one of the coastal cities like New York or San Francisco. They are rolling up their sleeves, getting to work, and making a difference. They are the epitome of an entrepreneur.

And I chose the same. I moved to Detroit to be one of the founding fathers of the startup software technology community in southeast Michigan, aka, Detroit. And from what I&rsquo;ve seen, Detroit is the ultimate entrepreneurial playground.

I&rsquo;ve joined forces with [Dan Gilbert][2], billionaire extraordinaire, hellbent on a mission to rebuild the midwest (Detroit, Cleveland, and Cincinnati), and [Josh Linkner][3], [NY Times Bestselling Author of Disciplined Dreaming][4], on a mission to bring creativity back to this world, starting first in Detroit.

Together, as part of [Detroit Venture Partners][5], we are on a mission to shatter conventional wisdom through software technology venture investments. I&rsquo;ll be writing more about this specifically in a future post.

The common thread that unites us is summed up well by [Josh&rsquo;s article in Forbes][6]: 

> Focus on impact more than personal gain. If you&rsquo;re championing a cause and making a difference, your results will be better and more widespread. 

Couldn&rsquo;t have said it any better myself.

But it&rsquo;s more than just us.

**Detroit is about to get hit by a perfect storm of economical drivers**. 

- **The Business Titans** &mdash; [Dan Gilbert][7] (founder of Quicken Loans, majority owner Cleveland Cavaliers), [Roger Penske][8] (owner of Penkse Racing and a number of related automobile companies), [Mike Ilitch][9] (owner of the Detroit Tigers, Detroit Red Wings and Little Caesars Pizza), and [Bill Ford][10] (yes, that Ford).

San Francisco and New York, not a chance. But in Michigan, you can. In fact, [5 towns in Michigan were rated by Money Magazine as best places to live][18].
- **Steve Blank said to Start Your Company Here** &mdash; One of the greatest minds in startups said to start your company in Michigan, not San Francisco. &lsquo;Nuff said.
